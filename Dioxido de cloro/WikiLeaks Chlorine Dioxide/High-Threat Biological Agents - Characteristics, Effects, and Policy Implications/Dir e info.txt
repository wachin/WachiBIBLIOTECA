About this CRS report

This document was obtained by Wikileaks from the United States Congressional Research Service.

The CRS is a Congressional "think tank" with a staff of around 700. Reports are commissioned by members of Congress on topics relevant to current political events. Despite CRS costs to the tax payer of over $100M a year, its electronic archives are, as a matter of policy, not made available to the public.

Individual members of Congress will release specific CRS reports if they believe it to assist them politically, but CRS archives as a whole are firewalled from public access.

This report was obtained by Wikileaks staff from CRS computers accessible only from Congressional offices.

Abstract
    Since the anthrax mailings of 2001, policymakers have been implementing programs to decrease the vulnerability of the United States to terrorist use of biological weapons. This report discusses high-threat biological agents, focusing on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for Category A pathogens (bacteria and viruses), their treatment and detection, current policies, and possible future approaches to reducing their threat.
